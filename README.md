PREDICTION AND SELECTION OF REGRESSION MODEL FOR COMBINED CYCLE POWER PLANT 

• Implementation of regression models, including multiple linear regression, support vector regression, decision tree regression, and random forest 
 regression, on the CCPP dataset and determined the regression score (R2) for each model.
 
• As a final finding, found that the Random Forest Regression Model performs best, having the highest Regression Score (R2) of 0.96.
